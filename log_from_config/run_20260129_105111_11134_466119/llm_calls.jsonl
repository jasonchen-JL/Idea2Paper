We propose Autoregressive Image Diffusion (AID), a novel generative framework that models the temporal dependencies of dynamic MRI through a sequence-aware diffusion process. To address the prohibitive computational cost typically associated with diffusion sampling in clinical settings, we integrate a Diffusion Exponential Integrator Sampler (DEIS). This approach reframes the sampling trajectory as a semilinear ordinary differential equation (ODE), allowing for significant reduction in function evaluations without sacrificing image quality. By combining the generative strength of autoregressive modeling with the numerical efficiency of exponential integrators, AID achieves rapid, high-quality posterior sampling, effectively bridging the gap between advanced generative theory and practical medical imaging requirements.\nProblem: We reframe accelerated MRI reconstruction from a simple static inverse problem to a complex task of dynamic temporal sequence generation requiring precise posterior sampling. Traditional methods often overlook the intricate temporal correlations inherent in dynamic MRI or rely on optimization strategies that fail to capture the full distribution of plausible solutions. By treating the reconstruction as an autoregressive image diffusion process, we transform the challenge into generating coherent, high-fidelity sequences that effectively sample the true posterior distribution defined by the physics of MRI acquisition.\nMethod: Construct the Autoregressive Image Diffusion (AID) architecture by factorizing the joint distribution of image sequences into conditional diffusion steps; Formulate the accelerated MRI reconstruction task as a constrained posterior sampling problem within the AID framework; Implement the Diffusion Exponential Integrator Sampler (DEIS) to discretize the probability flow ODE, leveraging the semilinear structure to minimize discretization error across autoregressive steps; Optimize the score network parameterization to support efficient deterministic sampling while maintaining temporal consistency.\nClaims: Transform accelerated MRI reconstruction from static optimization to dynamic Autoregressive Image Diffusion, enabling the generation of temporally coherent image sequences that accurately sample the complex posterior distribution., Reframe the computationally prohibitive sampling process by integrating the Diffusion Exponential Integrator Sampler (DEIS), which exploits the semilinear structure of diffusion ODEs to drastically reduce neural function evaluations while maintaining fidelity., Shift the paradigm of posterior sampling by combining autoregressive modeling with exponential integrators, bridging the gap between theoretical generative capabilities and the strict time constraints of clinical MRI workflows.\nExperiments: We evaluate AID on retrospective undersampled dynamic cardiac and brain MRI datasets.

We propose Autoregressive Image Diffusion (AID), a novel generative framework that models the temporal dependencies of dynamic MRI through a sequence-aware diffusion process. To address the prohibitive computational cost typically associated with diffusion sampling in clinical settings, we integrate a Diffusion Exponential Integrator Sampler (DEIS). This approach reframes the sampling trajectory as a semilinear ordinary differential equation (ODE), allowing for significant reduction in function evaluations without sacrificing image quality. By combining the generative strength of autoregressive modeling with the numerical efficiency of exponential integrators, AID achieves rapid, high-quality posterior sampling, effectively bridging the gap between advanced generative theory and practical medical imaging requirements.\nProblem Framing: We reframe accelerated MRI reconstruction from a simple static inverse problem to a complex task of dynamic temporal sequence generation requiring precise posterior sampling. Traditional methods often overlook the intricate temporal correlations inherent in dynamic MRI or rely on optimization strategies that fail to capture the full distribution of plausible solutions. By treating the reconstruction as an autoregressive image diffusion process, we transform the challenge into generating coherent, high-fidelity sequences that effectively sample the true posterior distribution defined by the physics of MRI acquisition.\nGap Pattern: Current diffusion-based generative models fail in clinical MRI applications because they require hundreds to thousands of expensive neural function evaluations, making real-time reconstruction infeasible. Furthermore, existing methods often treat image frames independently, lacking the autoregressive structure necessary to maintain temporal consistency in dynamic sequences. We identify a critical gap where the need for high-fidelity posterior sampling clashes with the computational inefficiency of standard stochastic sampling techniques and the lack of sequence-aware modeling.\nSolution: Our solution introduces Autoregressive Image Diffusion (AID), which leverages the semilinear structure of diffusion processes to enable efficient, high-fidelity sequence generation. We implement the Diffusion Exponential Integrator Sampler (DEIS) as the core engine to discretize the probability flow ODE, minimizing discretization error and drastically reducing the number of required steps. This approach transforms the sampling process from a slow stochastic walk into a rapid, deterministic trajectory that respects the autoregressive nature of the data.

Traditional approaches treat reconstruction as a static inverse problem or require task-specific training, failing to leverage the rich temporal dynamics of pre-trained video priors. We reframe the challenge as aligning the generative trajectory of a video diffusion model with the physical constraints of MRI acquisition in real-time. To achieve this, we introduce the Physics-Aware Exponential Integrator, a mechanism that integrates the MRI pseudo-inverse directly into the kernel of the Diffusion Exponential Integrator Sampler (DEIS). This structural integration transforms the sampling process from a stochastic walk guided by external gradients into a deterministic trajectory alignment, allowing the model to warp its generative path to satisfy k-space measurements without fine-tuning. AID not only preserves the temporal coherence inherent in the video prior but also drastically reduces neural function evaluations, bridging the gap between theoretical generative capabilities and the practical demands of clinical workflows.\nProblem Framing: We reframe accelerated MRI reconstruction from a static image restoration task to a dynamic problem of temporal trajectory synchronization.

Traditional approaches treat reconstruction as a static inverse problem or require task-specific training, failing to leverage the rich temporal dynamics of pre-trained video priors. We reframe the challenge as aligning the generative trajectory of a video diffusion model with the physical constraints of MRI acquisition in real-time. To achieve this, we introduce the Physics-Aware Exponential Integrator, a mechanism that integrates the MRI pseudo-inverse directly into the kernel of the Diffusion Exponential Integrator Sampler (DEIS). This structural integration transforms the sampling process from a stochastic walk guided by external gradients into a deterministic trajectory alignment, allowing the model to warp its generative path to satisfy k-space measurements without fine-tuning. AID not only preserves the temporal coherence inherent in the video prior but also drastically reduces neural function evaluations, bridging the gap between theoretical generative capabilities and the practical demands of clinical workflows.\nProblem Framing: We reframe accelerated MRI reconstruction from a static image restoration task to a dynamic problem of temporal trajectory synchronization. The core challenge lies in bridging the gap between the generic temporal dynamics of pre-trained video diffusion models and the specific acquisition physics of MRI. Unlike traditional methods that learn static mappings, we assume that the temporal consistency learned by universal video models is sufficient to approximate physiological dynamics, but requires precise alignment with MRI physics. This shifts the objective from generating pixel-perfect frames to warping the generative ODE trajectory so that it naturally converges to solutions consistent with undersampled k-space data, effectively treating the reconstruction as a trajectory control problem.\nGap Pattern: Current diffusion-based methods fail in clinical applications due to a fundamental disconnect between generative priors and physical constraints. Existing approaches either treat frames independently, ignoring temporal correlations, or rely on task-specific training that limits generalizability. Furthermore, standard conditional guidance techniques merely nudge the output, requiring hundreds of expensive function evaluations and failing to guarantee adherence to physics. We identify a critical gap where there is no mechanism to structurally unify the generative time-steps of video models with the physical constraints of MRI, leading to inefficient sampling and poor zero-shot generalization across diverse clinical scenarios.\nSolution: Our solution introduces Autoregressive Image Diffusion (AID) with a Physics-Aware Exponential Integrator, fundamentally transforming how posterior sampling is performed. Instead of relying on task-specific training, we leverage the autoregressive structure of pre-trained video models and synchronize their trajectory with MRI physics. By integrating the pseudo-inverse of the MRI forward model directly into the exponential integrator's structure, we transform the sampling process into a deterministic trajectory alignment problem. This allows the model to analytically correct its path to satisfy k-space constraints on the fly, eliminating the need for extra neural network evaluations. We effectively warp the universal video prior into a task-specific MRI emulator, achieving rapid, high-fidelity reconstruction that respects both temporal coherence and physical laws.\nMethod: Adopt a pre-trained video diffusion model to provide the autoregressive prior, factorizing the joint distribution of image sequences into conditional diffusion steps; Formulate the accelerated MRI reconstruction as a constrained posterior sampling problem where the probability flow ODE is modified to include the MRI physics gradient; Develop a Physics-Aware Exponential Integrator that analytically integrates the pseudo-inverse term into the exponential integration kernel, minimizing discretization error; Perform zero-shot reconstruction by solving the modified ODE, dynamically synchronizing the generative trajectory with k-space measurements without fine-tuning the network weights.\nClaims: [\"Transform accelerated MRI reconstruction from a static inverse problem to a dynamic trajectory synchronization task by aligning the generative time-steps of pre-trained video models with MRI physical constraints.\", \"Reframe constraint satisfaction from an external guidance process to an internal structural component by integrating the pseudo-inverse directly into the exponential integrator, enabling zero-shot posterior sampling with drastic efficiency gains.\", \"Shift the paradigm of medical imaging from task-specific model training to general-purpose trajectory warping, achieving high-fidelity dynamic MRI reconstruction by inheriting temporal reasoning from universal video priors.\"]\n\n【Review Feedback】(Read carefully, preserve well-received parts, deeply revise criticized parts)\n- Reviewer A (Methodology): 6.639999999999902分. 反馈: Main gaps: Limited theoretical analysis of convergence properties, Unclear generalizability beyond MRI reconstruction, Missing detailed ablation studies for method components.

This requires a mechanism that harmonizes these two distinct time-scales and manifolds without retraining, effectively transforming a universal video generator into a task-specific MRI emulator through trajectory control.\n\nNew Assumption: We assume that the temporal consistency learned by generic video diffusion models is sufficiently universal to approximate physiological dynamics, and that MRI physics constraints can be satisfied not by retraining the network, but by analytically correcting the probability flow ODE's trajectory using the pseudo-inverse in real-time.\n\nNew Novelty Claim: Unlike simply applying guidance to a generic model (Pattern), we integrate the pseudo-inverse directly into the sampler's structure (User) to create a 'Physics-Aware Exponential Integrator.' This transforms the pseudo-inverse from a mere gradient term into a structural component of the ODE solver, allowing the model to 'warp' its generative path to satisfy physics on the fly without extra neural function evaluations.\n\nWhy This is NOT Simple Combination:\nThis is not A+B because it doesn't just 'use' a pre-trained model with AID's sampler. Instead, it fundamentally alters the sampling mechanics by absorbing the Pattern's pseudo-inverse logic into the User's exponential integrator structure, thereby co-evolving the sampling efficiency and the physics constraint satisfaction into a single unified trajectory control mechanism.\n\nKey Innovation Points:\n  1. Trajectory Synchronization: Unifies video generation time-steps and MRI acquisition dynamics via ODE path correction.\n  2. Physics-Embedded Integrator: Modifies the DEIS kernel (from User) to analytically include pseudo-inverse guidance (from Pattern), reducing reconstruction to a deterministic trajectory solving problem.\n  3. Zero-Shot Temporal Inheritance: Leverages pre-trained video priors for temporal coherence without task-specific training, inheriting dynamic reasoning rather than just pixel textures.\n\n⚠️ CRITICAL: This fused idea represents a conceptual-level innovation, not just a technical combination.\nYour story refinement should reflect THIS NEW CONCEPTUAL INNOVATION in problem_framing, gap_pattern, and innovation_claims.\nThis is the KEY to achieving higher novelty scores - moving from \"combination of techniques\" to \"new perspective on the problem\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n【针对创新性问题的特别指导】\n当前方法被评审认为\"创新性不足\"或\"技术组合常见\"。你需要：\n1. 在 method_skeleton 中，突出新注入技术的**独特应用方式**，形成与众不同的技术路线。\n2. 在 innovation_claims 中，明确指出你的技术组合与现有工作的**本质区别**。\n3. 避免使用\"提升性能\"、\"增强效果\"等泛泛而谈的描述，要具体说明技术创新点。\n\n\n【Pattern Reference】(Use these to enhance technical depth and narrative)\n\n💡 Solution Approaches (add concrete technical steps if needed):\n  1. Develop the Diffusion Exponential Integrator Sampler (DEIS) using an exponential integrator for discretizing ODEs, leveraging the semilinear structure of diffusion processes to minimize discretization error and reduce the number of required steps.\n  2. Modify the score network parameterization in DDIM to extend its applicability to general diffusion models, enabling efficient deterministic sampling.\n  3. Develop quasi-Taylor samplers using numerical schemes based on Taylor expansion, employing an 'ideal derivative substitution' to simplify the computation of higher-order derivatives.\n\n📖 Story Packaging Strategy (use 'Reframe/Transform' pattern for claims):\n  1. Transform the challenge of slow sampling in diffusion models by reframing it as an opportunity to innovate on numerical methods, introducing a scalable approach that enhances efficiency without sacrificing quality, thus pushing the boundaries of generative modeling capabilities.\n  2. Reframe diffusion model sampling from a stochastic process to a deterministic one by leveraging numerical insights, thus broadening the applicability and efficiency of diffusion models beyond isotropic cases.\n\nRemember: These are TOOLS to implement the User Idea, not the main focus.\n\n\n⚠️ 【HOW TO USE Fused Idea Guidance】\nIf you received 【Conceptual Innovation from Idea Fusion】 above, this is THE MOST IMPORTANT guidance:\n- **Title & Abstract**: Must reflect the fused conceptual innovation, not just list techniques\n- **Problem Framing**: Adopt the NEW problem perspective from the fused idea\n- **Gap Pattern**: Explain why existing methods lack this conceptual unity\n- **Innovation Claims**: Frame as \"transforming/reframing X fro", "simulated": false, "prompt_truncated": true, "prompt_len": 15701}, "response": {"ok": true, "text": "```json\n{\n  \"title\": \"Autoregressive Image Diffusion via Physics-Trajectory Synchronization for Zero-Shot MRI Reconstruction\",\n  \"abstract\": \"We propose Autoregressive Image Diffusion (AID), a novel framework for image sequence generation that achieves high-fidelity accelerated MRI reconstruction by sampling the posterior distribution through zero-shot physics-trajectory synchronization.

To achieve this, we introduce the Physics-Aware Exponential Integrator, a mechanism that integrates the MRI pseudo-inverse directly into the kernel of the Diffusion Exponential Integrator Sampler (DEIS).

This shifts the objective from generating pixel-perfect frames to warping the generative ODE trajectory so that it naturally converges to solutions consistent with undersampled k-space data, effectively treating the reconstruction as a trajectory control problem.\nMethod: Adopt a pre-trained video diffusion model to provide the autoregressive prior, factorizing the joint distribution of image sequences into conditional diffusion steps; Formulate the accelerated MRI reconstruction as a constrained posterior sampling problem where the probability flow ODE is modified to include the MRI physics gradient; Develop a Physics-Aware Exponential Integrator that leverages the semilinear structure of the diffusion process to analytically integrate the pseudo-inverse term into the exponential integration kernel, minimizing discretization error; Perform zero-shot reconstruction by solving the modified ODE using the deterministic sampler, dynamically synchronizing the generative trajectory with k-space measurements without fine-tuning the network weights.\nClaims: Transform accelerated MRI reconstruction from a static inverse problem to a dynamic trajectory synchronization task by aligning the generative time-steps of pre-trained video models with MRI physical constraints., Reframe constraint satisfaction from an external guidance process to an internal structural component by integrating the pseudo-inverse directly into the exponential integrator, enabling zero-shot posterior sampling with drastic efficiency gains and theoretical convergence guarantees., Shift the paradigm of medical imaging from task-specific model training to general-purpose trajectory warping, achieving high-fidelity dynamic MRI reconstruction by inheriting temporal reasoning from universal video priors.\nExperiments: We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on diverse clinical MRI datasets (cardiac and brain) to validate zero-shot generalizability. We compare AID against state-of-the-art diffusion-based MRI reconstruction methods and standard video generation models, measuring PSNR, SSIM, and temporal metrics. Crucially, we include a theoretical analysis section proving the convergence properties of the Physics-Aware Exponential Integrator and provide ablation studies comparing our modified kernel against standard DEIS and other numerical samplers to demonstrate the reduction in function evaluations and improved trajectory stability.\n\nTask:\nFor each anchor, decide whether the Story is better, tie, or worse on Storyteller, and provide confidence (0-1).\nYou must mention the anchor's score10 in the rationale using the format \"score10: X.X\".\nComparisons must include every anchor exactly once.\nEach rationale must be ONE sentence (<=25 words).\n\nOutput JSON ONLY.
