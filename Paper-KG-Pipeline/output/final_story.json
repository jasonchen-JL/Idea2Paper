  "title": "Autoregressive Image Diffusion via Physics-Trajectory Synchronization for Zero-Shot MRI Reconstruction",
  "abstract": "We propose Autoregressive Image Diffusion (AID), a novel framework for image sequence generation that achieves high-fidelity accelerated MRI reconstruction by sampling the posterior distribution through zero-shot physics-trajectory synchronization. Traditional approaches treat reconstruction as a static inverse problem or require task-specific training, failing to leverage the rich temporal dynamics of pre-trained video priors. We reframe the challenge as aligning the generative trajectory of a video diffusion model with the physical constraints of MRI acquisition in real-time. To achieve this, we introduce the Physics-Aware Exponential Integrator, a mechanism that integrates the MRI pseudo-inverse directly into the kernel of the Diffusion Exponential Integrator Sampler (DEIS). By leveraging the semilinear structure of the diffusion ODE, this structural integration transforms the sampling process from a stochastic walk guided by external gradients into a deterministic trajectory alignment. This allows the model to analytically correct its path to satisfy k-space measurements without fine-tuning, preserving temporal coherence while drastically reducing neural function evaluations.",
  "problem_framing": "We reframe accelerated MRI reconstruction from a static image restoration task to a dynamic problem of temporal trajectory synchronization. The core challenge lies in bridging the gap between the generic temporal dynamics of pre-trained video diffusion models and the specific acquisition physics of MRI. Unlike traditional methods that learn static mappings, we assume that the temporal consistency learned by universal video models is sufficient to approximate physiological dynamics, but requires precise alignment with MRI physics. This shifts the objective from generating pixel-perfect frames to warping the generative ODE trajectory so that it naturally converges to solutions consistent with undersampled k-space data, effectively treating the reconstruction as a trajectory control problem.",
  "gap_pattern": "Current diffusion-based methods fail in clinical applications due to a fundamental disconnect between generative priors and physical constraints. Existing approaches either treat frames independently, ignoring temporal correlations, or rely on task-specific training that limits generalizability. Furthermore, standard conditional guidance techniques merely nudge the output, requiring hundreds of expensive function evaluations and failing to guarantee adherence to physics. We identify a critical gap where there is no mechanism to structurally unify the generative time-steps of video models with the physical constraints of MRI, leading to inefficient sampling, poor convergence properties, and weak zero-shot generalization across diverse clinical scenarios.",
  "solution": "Our solution introduces Autoregressive Image Diffusion (AID) with a Physics-Aware Exponential Integrator, fundamentally transforming how posterior sampling is performed. Instead of relying on task-specific training, we leverage the autoregressive structure of pre-trained video models and synchronize their trajectory with MRI physics. By integrating the pseudo-inverse of the MRI forward model directly into the exponential integrator's structure, we transform the sampling process into a deterministic trajectory alignment problem. This allows the model to analytically correct its path to satisfy k-space constraints on the fly, eliminating the need for extra neural network evaluations. We effectively warp the universal video prior into a task-specific MRI emulator, achieving rapid, high-fidelity reconstruction that respects both temporal coherence and physical laws.",
