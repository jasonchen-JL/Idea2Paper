    "title": "Empirical AST Simulation: A Multi-Agent Evolutionary Framework for Automated Code Refactoring",
    "abstract": "Automated code refactoring is traditionally viewed as a static transformation process or a rule-based negotiation, often hindered by the inability to verify the runtime integrity of proposed changes. This paper reimagines Automated Code Refactoring as a collaborative empirical simulation managed by a Multi-Agent System operating directly on the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). We propose a novel framework where the AST serves as a dynamic 'simulation sandbox,' enabling agents to act as hypothesis-testers rather than mere negotiators. By integrating a GMRES-based optimization mechanism for resolving competing objectives and a CLEP-inspired evolutionary selection protocol for validating mutations against execution feedback, our system ensures logical equivalence and semantic robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that this empirical approach significantly outperforms static baselines in preserving functional semantics and handling large-scale codebases through efficient graph shift operators.",
    "problem_framing": "We reframe automated code refactoring from a static text transformation or a collaborative debate into an 'evolutionary simulation' problem. The core challenge is not simply how to apply rules or reach a consensus on code style, but how to enable a system to empirically validate potential code states within a high-fidelity simulation environment. By treating the AST as an executable state machine subject to real-world logic constraints, we shift the focus from generating syntactically correct edits to discovering logically robust architectural mutations that preserve runtime integrity.",
    "gap_pattern": "Existing approaches to code refactoring fail to realize the potential of a Multi-Agent System because they predominantly rely on static negotiation or black-box neural generation, lacking empirical grounding. These methods neglect the dynamic nature of code execution, often leading to semantically unsound outputs that break runtime integrity. Furthermore, current frameworks lack mechanisms for 'hypothesis testing'; they treat refactoring as a deterministic application of rules rather than an evolutionary process where code mutations must survive verification against logic constraints and best practices, missing the opportunity for robust code evolution.",
    "solution": "Our solution introduces a collaborative framework where a Multi-Agent System utilizes the AST as a simulation sandbox for empirical refactoring. Drawing inspiration from self-representation and evolutionary selection, we empower agents to act as hypothesis-testers, proposing structural mutations that are optimized using Krylov subspace methods (GMRES) to satisfy conflicting constraints. The system integrates a probabilistic negotiation protocol, modeled by community-specific embeddings (CLEP), to evaluate mutations based on execution feedback and historical precedent. By framing interactions as a 'Scientific Method' workflow—proposal, execution-verification, and knowledge-based selection—we ensure that the final AST transformation is not only syntactically valid but also logically robust, transforming code maintenance into a structured evolutionary process.",
    "method_skeleton": "Parse source code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and initialize a simulation sandbox by modeling the AST as a non-uniform geometric graph, correcting graph shift operators to handle structural mutations; Deploy specialized agents that utilize a GMRES-based self-representation framework to optimize latent edit proposals within Krylov subspaces, treating refactoring constraints as a least squares problem to balance competing objectives; Implement a probabilistic evolutionary selection mechanism using CLEP, where agent proposals are modeled as edge generations across hidden communities, validated by an embedded interpreter and contrastive objective against best practices; Synthesize the final code by applying mutations that survive the empirical verification cycle, ensuring the output represents a mathematically grounded consensus.",
    "innovation_claims": [
      "Transform Automated Code Refactoring from a syntactic transformation task into an empirical simulation process by treating the AST as an executable state machine, enabling agents to validate mutations against runtime logic rather than static rules.",
      "Transform the agent decision-making process from opinion-based negotiation to hypothesis-driven optimization by integrating GMRES over Krylov subspaces, allowing agents to mathematically resolve conflicting refactoring objectives as a least squares problem.",
      "Transform the consensus mechanism from probabilistic voting to evolutionary selection by unifying interpreter feedback with community-specific embeddings (CLEP), ensuring that only semantically verified mutations aligned with external knowledge survive."
    ],
    "experiments_plan": "We evaluate our framework on large-scale Python and Java repositories, comparing against static rule-based refactoring tools and standard multi-agent negotiation baselines. Metrics include functional correctness (test pass rate), semantic preservation (embedding similarity), and scalability (performance relative to AST size). Ablation studies will isolate the contributions of the GMRES optimization module and the CLEP evolutionary selection protocol to validate the theoretical claims regarding efficiency and robustness."
