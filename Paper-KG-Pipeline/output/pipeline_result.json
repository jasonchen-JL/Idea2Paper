    "title": "Autoregressive Image Diffusion via Physics-Trajectory Synchronization for Zero-Shot MRI Reconstruction",
    "abstract": "We propose Autoregressive Image Diffusion (AID), a novel framework for image sequence generation that achieves high-fidelity accelerated MRI reconstruction by sampling the posterior distribution through zero-shot physics-trajectory synchronization. Traditional approaches treat reconstruction as a static inverse problem or require task-specific training, failing to leverage the rich temporal dynamics of pre-trained video priors. We reframe the challenge as aligning the generative trajectory of a video diffusion model with the physical constraints of MRI acquisition in real-time. To achieve this, we introduce the Physics-Aware Exponential Integrator, a mechanism that integrates the MRI pseudo-inverse directly into the kernel of the Diffusion Exponential Integrator Sampler (DEIS). By leveraging the semilinear structure of the diffusion ODE, this structural integration transforms the sampling process from a stochastic walk guided by external gradients into a deterministic trajectory alignment. This allows the model to analytically correct its path to satisfy k-space measurements without fine-tuning, preserving temporal coherence while drastically reducing neural function evaluations.",
    "problem_framing": "We reframe accelerated MRI reconstruction from a static image restoration task to a dynamic problem of temporal trajectory synchronization. The core challenge lies in bridging the gap between the generic temporal dynamics of pre-trained video diffusion models and the specific acquisition physics of MRI. Unlike traditional methods that learn static mappings, we assume that the temporal consistency learned by universal video models is sufficient to approximate physiological dynamics, but requires precise alignment with MRI physics. This shifts the objective from generating pixel-perfect frames to warping the generative ODE trajectory so that it naturally converges to solutions consistent with undersampled k-space data, effectively treating the reconstruction as a trajectory control problem.",
    "gap_pattern": "Current diffusion-based methods fail in clinical applications due to a fundamental disconnect between generative priors and physical constraints. Existing approaches either treat frames independently, ignoring temporal correlations, or rely on task-specific training that limits generalizability. Furthermore, standard conditional guidance techniques merely nudge the output, requiring hundreds of expensive function evaluations and failing to guarantee adherence to physics. We identify a critical gap where there is no mechanism to structurally unify the generative time-steps of video models with the physical constraints of MRI, leading to inefficient sampling, poor convergence properties, and weak zero-shot generalization across diverse clinical scenarios.",
    "solution": "Our solution introduces Autoregressive Image Diffusion (AID) with a Physics-Aware Exponential Integrator, fundamentally transforming how posterior sampling is performed. Instead of relying on task-specific training, we leverage the autoregressive structure of pre-trained video models and synchronize their trajectory with MRI physics. By integrating the pseudo-inverse of the MRI forward model directly into the exponential integrator's structure, we transform the sampling process into a deterministic trajectory alignment problem. This allows the model to analytically correct its path to satisfy k-space constraints on the fly, eliminating the need for extra neural network evaluations. We effectively warp the universal video prior into a task-specific MRI emulator, achieving rapid, high-fidelity reconstruction that respects both temporal coherence and physical laws.",
    "method_skeleton": "Adopt a pre-trained video diffusion model to provide the autoregressive prior, factorizing the joint distribution of image sequences into conditional diffusion steps; Formulate the accelerated MRI reconstruction as a constrained posterior sampling problem where the probability flow ODE is modified to include the MRI physics gradient; Develop a Physics-Aware Exponential Integrator that leverages the semilinear structure of the diffusion process to analytically integrate the pseudo-inverse term into the exponential integration kernel, minimizing discretization error; Perform zero-shot reconstruction by solving the modified ODE using the deterministic sampler, dynamically synchronizing the generative trajectory with k-space measurements without fine-tuning the network weights.",
    "innovation_claims": [
      "Transform accelerated MRI reconstruction from a static inverse problem to a dynamic trajectory synchronization task by aligning the generative time-steps of pre-trained video models with MRI physical constraints.",
      "Reframe constraint satisfaction from an external guidance process to an internal structural component by integrating the pseudo-inverse directly into the exponential integrator, enabling zero-shot posterior sampling with drastic efficiency gains and theoretical convergence guarantees.",
      "Shift the paradigm of medical imaging from task-specific model training to general-purpose trajectory warping, achieving high-fidelity dynamic MRI reconstruction by inheriting temporal reasoning from universal video priors."

    "experiments_plan": "We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on diverse clinical MRI datasets (cardiac and brain) to validate zero-shot generalizability. We compare AID against state-of-the-art diffusion-based MRI reconstruction methods and standard video generation models, measuring PSNR, SSIM, and temporal metrics. Crucially, we include a theoretical analysis section proving the convergence properties of the Physics-Aware Exponential Integrator and provide ablation studies comparing our modified kernel against standard DEIS and other numerical samplers to demonstrate the reduction in function evaluations and improved trajectory stability."
